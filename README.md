This project is archieved and I have updated my portfolio to https://github.com/kobayashikento/portfolio

This is my personal website that I created using React. The purpose of this website is to show my skills in web design. I focused more on color scheme, fonts, spacing between each element and user interaction. For the animations I used React-Spring for the transition of each element because it provided more real like animations. For the transition of the modal when the card is clicked I used react-reveal. I used the network animation from https://github.com/JulianLaval/canvas-particle-network as an starting bases, but changed it to fit my needs and made it compatible with my code in React.
